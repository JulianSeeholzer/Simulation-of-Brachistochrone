# Simulation-of-Brachistochrone
This project was created for a scientific work on the so called brachistochrone problem. The brachistochrone problem is a challenge proposed by Johann Bernoulli to leading mathematicians in the year 1696. The challenge was to find a solution for the curve on which a point will slide without friction from a point A to a point B in the shortest time only due to the gravitational pull acting on it. There for the name Brachistochrone (gr. brachystos = shortest, chronos = time). Bernoulli found the solution to be a cycloid. In this project I know programmed a little physics simulation of the brachistochrone curve and another curve for comparison for different physical systems. The different systems are:
- System with friction
- System with rotation
- System with friction and rotation
The simulations are written in python with the main libraries pymunk and pygamen used and to create a GUI Tkinter was used.
